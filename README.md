## Introduction
Figuring out the robot's real-time location is thought to be the starting point for applying the digital twin in industrial environments. Although Gazbo is used a lot for robot control, we think it would be better to proceed in Unity considering its scalability, so we are going to make simulation SW in Unity for IndyRP2, a cooperative robot.
