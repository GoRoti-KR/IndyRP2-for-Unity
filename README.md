## Introduction
Figuring out the robot's real-time location is thought to be the starting point for applying the digital twin in industrial environments. Although Gazbo is used a lot for robot control, we think it would be better to proceed in Unity considering its scalability, so we are going to make simulation SW in Unity for IndyRP2, a cooperative robot.

| SW | Ver |
|---|---|
| OS | Window 11 / WSL2(Ubuntu 22.04) |
| Unity version | Unity 22.3.28f1 |
| Robot | Neuromeka Indy RP2 |
<br/>

## Getting Started
### [Unity Side (Window 11)](https://github.com/GoRoti-KR/IndyRP2-for-Unity/blob/main/0_Unity%20Setting%20(Window%2011).md)
Used URDF Importer, ROS TCP Connector, ROS TCP Endpoint
<br/>

### [IndyRP2 Side (WSL2)](https://github.com/GoRoti-KR/IndyRP2-for-Unity/blob/main/1_IndyRP2%20Setting%20(WSL2-ROS2%20Humble))
Install Indy-ros2 Package [link](https://github.com/neuromeka-robotics/indy-ros2/blob/humble-indyDCP3/README.md)
<br/>
<br/>
